# Gen Social (gesock)

Gen Social is a small Python CLI tool named `gesock` to generate social media
images for the Open Graph protocol. It uses ImageMagick to position text on top
of a provided template image.

This CLI tool is most useful for generating multiple unique Open Graph images
that can be used for each unique post on a blog or specific pages of a website.

Gen Social expects a `$XDG_CONFIG/gesock/layout.toml` file to be present in
order to layout text blocks effectively.

## Installation

This project uses *Nix* and `direnv` for setting up the development environment
using `.venv`. This will change in the future.
